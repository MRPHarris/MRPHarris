## G'day! :wave:
My name's Matt. I research past and present climate change, mostly through ice cores, and mostly in/around Antarctica. I dabble in open-source software development (chiefly *R*) to help answer research questinos.

A significant portion of my work to date has been related to the analysis of fluorescent organic matter (FOM) in ice cores, which was the core focus of my PhD.

### R packages (functional)
Research inevitably involves grappling with new problems, or adjusting pre-existing approaches. I've made a range of R packages to help along the way:
  - CS3 [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/CS3): an implementation of component-versus-spectral similarity for three-dimensional fluorescence model (PARAFAC) validation.
  - SampleQueue [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/SampleQueue): an automated file data processing system for the HORIBA Aqualog fluorimeter.
  - eemUtils [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/eemutils): various functions to expand upon the existing fluorescence analysis framework in R.
  - ERA5handlers [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/ERA5handlers): simple functions for reading and parsing ERA-5 reanalysis data from the Copernicus CDS.

### R packages (work-in-progress)
These packages are ongoing projects that may or may not function currently:
  - trajSpatial [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/trajSpatial): spatio-temporal analysis of endpoint data from the NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory modelling system.
  - metfetchR [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/metfetchR): a multi-computer meteorological data query and fetching system for running the NOAA HYSPLIT model with large ERA-5 data files.
