## G'day! :wave:
My name's Matt. I research past and present climate change, mostly through ice cores, and mostly in/around Antarctica. I dabble in open-source software development (chiefly *R*) to help answer research questinos.

A large portion of my work to date has been related to the analysis of fluorescent organic matter (FOM) in ice cores, which was the core focus of my PhD, and has been the focus of a significant amount of my coding efforts. 

I have also spent quite a bit of time running, and analysing outputs from, NOAA's HYSPLIT atmospheric trajectory model.

### R packages (functional)
Research inevitably involves grappling with new problems, or adjusting pre-existing approaches. I've made a range of R packages to help along the way:
  - CS3 [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/CS3): an implementation of component-versus-spectral similarity for three-dimensional fluorescence model (PARAFAC) validation.
  - SampleQueue [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/SampleQueue): an automated file data processing system for the HORIBA Aqualog fluorimeter.
  - eemUtils [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/eemutils): various functions to expand upon the existing fluorescence analysis framework in R.
  - ERA5handlers [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/ERA5handlers): simple functions for reading and parsing ERA-5 reanalysis data from the Copernicus CDS.

### R packages (work-in-progress)
These packages are ongoing projects that may or may not function currently:
  - trajSpatial [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/trajSpatial): spatio-temporal analysis of endpoint data from the NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory modelling system.
  - metfetchR [GitHub](https://github.com/MRPHarris/metfetchR): a multi-computer meteorological data query and fetching system for running the NOAA HYSPLIT model with large ERA-5 data files.
