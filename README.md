My name's Matt. I research past and present climate change, mostly in the high-latitude southern hemisphere (Antarctica and the Southern Ocean). To do this, I use chemistry and modelling to analyse palaeoclimate signals preserved in environmental archives. 

My research to date has had a particular focus on novel organic fractions in ice cores, specifically fluorescent organic matter (FOM). This has entailed a bit of software development related to spectra and three-dimensional data-wrangling!
